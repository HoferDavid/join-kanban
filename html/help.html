            <h1>Help</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the help page for <a href="../index.html">Join</a>, your guide to using our kanban project
                management tool. Here, we'll
                provide
                an overview of what <a href="../index.html">Join</a> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p><a href="../index.html">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group
                of
                dedicated students as part of
                their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                <br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a href="../index.html">Join</a> leverages the
                principles of kanban to help users
                manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                <br>
                It is important to note that <a href="../index.html">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise and
                is
                not intended for extensive
                business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
                consistent
                availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <a
                    href="../index.html">Join</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="../index.html">Join</a>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h2>1.</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                        <p>When you log in to <a href="../index.html">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board
                            represents
                            your project and contains four
                            default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>2.</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                        <p>In <a href="../index.html">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                            to the
                            "Contacts" section, click on "New
                            contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                            tasks and
                            they can
                            interact with the tasks on the board.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>3.</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                        <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                            tasks. Click
                            the
                            "+"
                            button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the
                            card, like task
                            name,
                            description, due date, assignees, etc.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>4.</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                        <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
                            and dropping the card from one list to another.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>5.</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                        <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                            card
                            will
                            permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                            action is
                            irreversible.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Remember that using <a href="../index.html">Join</a> effectively requires consistent updates from you and
            your
            team to ensure the board
            reflects the current state of your project.
