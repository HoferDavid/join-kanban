            <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to GDPR:</strong> Below you will find an overview of the legal
                bases
                of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the
                GDPR,
                national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or establishment. If
                more
                specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you about them in the privacy
                policy.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given
                    consent
                    to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b)
                        GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
                    subject
                    is party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures requested by the data subject.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is
                    necessary
                    for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except
                    where
                    such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
                    subject
                    which require protection of personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, national data
                protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the Federal Data Protection Act
                (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). The BDSG contains special regulations regarding the right to
                information,
                the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data,
                processing
                for other purposes, transmission, as well as automated decision-making including profiling. Furthermore,
                state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
            <p><strong>Reference to the applicability of GDPR and Swiss DPA:</strong> These privacy notices serve both
                as
                information under the Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG) and under the General Data Protection Regulation
                (GDPR). Therefore, please note that due to broader geographical application and comprehensibility, the
                terms
                used in the GDPR are employed. Specifically, instead of terms used in the Swiss DPA such as "processing"
                of
                "personal data," "predominant interest," and "particularly sensitive personal data," the GDPR terms
                "processing" of "personal data," "legitimate interest," and "special categories of data" are used.
                However,
                the legal meaning of these terms is determined in accordance with the Swiss DPA within the scope of its
                applicability.</p>

            <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements,
                taking
                into account the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of
                processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of
                natural
                persons, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
            <p>These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
                by
                controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, transmission,
                security
                of availability, and separation thereof. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the
                exercise
                of data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats. We also consider data
                protection principles in the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, in
                accordance
                with the principles of data protection by design and by default.</p>

            <h2 id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
            <p>In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other
                entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or persons or disclosed to them.
                Recipients
                of this data may include, for example, IT service providers responsible for IT tasks or providers of
                services and content integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with legal requirements and, in
                particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to
                protect your data.</p>
            <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Data Processing in Third Countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European
                Union
                (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if processing occurs in the context of using third-party
                services or disclosing/transferring data to other individuals, entities, or companies, this is done in
                accordance with legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been
                recognized
                through an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise,
                data
                transfers will only take place if the data protection level is otherwise ensured, especially through
                standard contractual clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR), explicit consent, or in the case of
                contractual
                or legally required transfers (Art. 49 para. 1 GDPR). Furthermore, we inform you about the bases for
                third-country transfers with each provider from the third country, with adequacy decisions primarily
                serving
                as the basis. Information on third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found on the
                European Commission's information page: <a
                    href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=en"
                    target="_blank">https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=en</a>.
            </p>
            <p>EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: Under the "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission
                has
                also recognized the level of data protection as safe for certain companies from the USA through adequacy
                decisions dated July 10, 2023. You can find the list of certified companies and further information on
                the
                DPF on the website of the US Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/"
                    target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a> (in English). In our privacy notices, we
                inform you which service providers certified under the Data Privacy Framework we use.</p>

            <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
            <p>We delete personal data we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the underlying
                consents
                are revoked or there are no longer any legal grounds for processing. This applies to cases where the
                original purpose of processing no longer exists or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule
                exist when legal obligations or special interests require longer retention or archiving of the data.</p>
            <p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary for
                legal prosecution or for the protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived
                accordingly.</p>
            <p>Our privacy notices contain additional information on the storage and deletion of data that specifically
                applies to certain processing operations.</p>
            <p>Where multiple indications of retention periods or deletion deadlines for a date exist, the longest
                period
                always applies.</p>
            <p>If a period does not explicitly begin on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically
                starts
                at the end of the calendar year in which the triggering event occurred. In the case of ongoing
                contractual
                relationships under which data is stored, the triggering event is the date of the effectiveness of
                termination or other termination of the legal relationship.</p>
            <p>Data that is no longer needed for its originally intended purpose but is retained due to legal
                requirements
                or other reasons will only be processed for the reasons that justify its retention.</p>
            <p><strong>Further information on processing procedures, processes, and services:</strong></p>
            <ul class="m-elements">
                <li><strong>Retention and deletion of data:</strong> The following general periods apply for retention

                            their understanding, booking documents, and invoices (§ 147 para. 3 in conjunction with
                            para. 1

                        <li>6 years - Other business records: received commercial or business letters, copies of sent

                            if
                            they are not already booking documents and cash strips (§ 147 para. 3 in conjunction with
                            para.
                            1 nos. 2, 3, 5 AO, § 257 para. 1 nos. 2 and 3, para. 4 HGB).</li>
                        <li>3 years - Data necessary to consider potential warranty and compensation claims or similar
                            contractual claims and rights, as well as associated inquiries, based on previous business
                            experience and common industry practices, are stored for the duration of the regular
                            statutory
                            limitation period of three years (§§ 195, 199 BGB).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
            <p>Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: Data subjects have various rights under the GDPR, which arise in
                particular from Articles 15 to 21 GDPR:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your
                    particular
                    situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Article
                    6(1)(e)
                    or (f) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. Where personal data are processed for
                    direct
                    marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data
                    concerning
                    you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct
                    marketing.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> You have the right to withdraw consent you have given at
                    any
                    time.</li>
                <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or
                    not
                    personal data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the
                    personal
                    data and other information as per legal requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You have the right to obtain the rectification of
                    inaccurate
                    personal data concerning you or the completion of incomplete personal data as per legal
                    requirements.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Right to erasure and restriction of processing:</strong> You have the right, subject to
                    legal
                    requirements, to request the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay or
                    alternatively to request restriction of processing of the data as per legal requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive the personal data
                    concerning
                    you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and
                    have
                    the right to transmit those data to another controller as per legal requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</strong> Without prejudice to any
                    other
                    administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
                    authority,

                it
                from them. For example, to store the log-in status in a user account, a shopping cart content in an

            <p><strong>Notes on Consent:</strong> We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. Therefore, we
                obtain
                prior consent from users unless it is not required by law. In particular, permission is not necessary if
                storing and retrieving information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary to provide users with a
                telemedia service (i.e., our online offering) that they have explicitly requested. Revocable consent is

                processing
                their data is the declared consent. Otherwise, data processed using cookies is based on our legitimate
                interests (e.g., in the operational business of our online offering and improving its usability) or, if
                necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations, when the use of cookies is necessary to

                </li>
                <li><strong>Permanent Cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after closing the device.
                    For
                    example, the login status can be stored, and preferred content can be displayed directly when the
                    user
                    visits a website again. The user data collected using cookies may also be used for reach
                    measurement. If

            <p>Web analysis (also known as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the visitor flows to our online
                offer
                and may
                include pseudonymous values ​​that reflect the behavior, interests or demographic information of
                visitors,
                such as
                age or gender. Through reach analysis, for example, we can determine at what time our online offer or
                its
                functions
                or contents are most frequently used, or invite reuse. Likewise, it enables us to track which areas
                require
                optimization.</p>
            <p>In addition to web analysis, we may also use test procedures to test and optimize different versions of
                our
                online
                offer or its components.</p>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, i.e. summarized data relating to a user process, may be created
                and
                information stored in a browser or on an end device for these purposes, and then read. The information
                collected
                may include in particular visited websites and elements used there, as well as technical information
                such as
                the

            <p>In addition, users' IP addresses are stored. However, we use an IP masking procedure (i.e.
                pseudonymization
                by
                shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear data of users (such as email addresses
                or
                names)
                is stored in the context of web analysis, A/B testing, and optimization, but pseudonyms. This means that
                we
                and the
                providers of the software used do not know the actual identity of the users, only the information stored

                profiles for the purpose of the respective procedures.</p>

                <li><strong>Meta-, Communication, and Process Data:</strong> Meta-, communication, and process data are
                    categories that contain information about how data is processed, transmitted, and managed. Metadata,
                    also known as data about data, include information that describes the context, origin, and structure
                    of
                    other data. They can include details such as file size, creation date, document author, and change
                    histories. Communication data captures the exchange of information between users across various
                    channels, such as email traffic, call logs, messages on social networks, and chat histories,
                    including
                    the persons involved, timestamps, and transmission routes. Process data describes the processes and
                    procedures within systems or organizations, including workflow documentation, transaction and
                    activity
                    logs, and audit logs used for tracking and verifying operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Usage data refers to information that captures how users interact with
                    digital products, services, or platforms. These data encompass a wide range of information that
                    shows
                    how users use applications, which features they prefer, how long they stay on specific pages, and
                    the
                    paths they navigate through an application. Usage data may also include frequency of use, activity
                    timestamps, IP addresses, device information, and location data. They are particularly valuable for
                    analyzing user behavior, optimizing user experiences, personalizing content, and improving products
                    or
                    services. Additionally, usage data play a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and
                    potential
                    problem areas within digital offerings.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> "Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or
                    identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as "data subject"); an identifiable natural
                    person
                    is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier
                    such
                    as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g., cookie), or to one
                    or
                    more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social
                    identity of that natural person.</li>
                <li><strong>Profiles with User-Related Information:</strong> The processing of "profiles with
                    user-related
                    information," or simply "profiles," includes any type of automated processing of personal data that
                    consists of using such personal data to analyze, assess, or predict certain personal aspects
                    relating to
                    a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, different information regarding demographics,
                    behavior, and interests, such as interaction with websites and their content, etc., may be
                    included).
                    Cookies and web beacons are often used for profiling purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Log data refers to information about events or activities that have been
                    logged within a system or network. This data typically includes details such as timestamps, IP
                    addresses, user actions, error messages, and other details about the use or operation of a system.
                    Log
                    data is often used for analyzing system issues, security monitoring, or creating performance
                    reports.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reach Measurement:</strong> Reach measurement (also known as web analytics) is used to
                    evaluate
                    visitor flows to an online offering and may include analyzing visitor behavior or interests in
                    specific
                    information, such as content on websites. With the help of reach analysis, operators of online
                    offerings
                    can, for example, determine when users visit their websites and which content they are interested
                    in.
                    This enables them to better tailor website content to the needs of their visitors. Pseudonymous
                    cookies
                    and web beacons are often used for reach analysis purposes to recognize returning visitors and
                    obtain
                    more accurate analyses of the usage of an online offering.</li>
                <li><strong>Controller:</strong> The "controller" is the natural or legal person, authority,
                    institution, or
                    other body that alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of
                    personal data.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> "Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is
                    performed on
                    personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization,
